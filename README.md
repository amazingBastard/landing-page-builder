## Roadmap

### Features

* Markdown editor for home and posts views
* Edit header and footer content
* Admin login

## How to use

### Requirements

Make sure [Meteor is installed and up to date](https://www.meteor.com/install) or run:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:amazingBastard/landing-page-builder.git
cd landing-page-builder
meteor
```

### Deployments

It is highly recommended to use [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) for easy deployments.
Have a look at the repository for more information.

### SEO and other concerns

> Meteor cannot do SEO

This statement is only partially true, since there is a package called [ms-seo](https://github.com/DerMambo/ms-seo), which
has a lot of neat little tricks to help web crawlers notice your app the way you want them to. Use constants under
__client/lib/constants.js__ for the app. Change SEO settings inside the routes like that.

```javascript
Router.route('/about', function () {
  this.render('about');
  // Using the app constants
  SEO.set({ title: 'About -' + Meteor.App.NAME, og: {...} });
});
```

### Adding allow rules for external URLs

The [browser-policy](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy) adds rules to deny all operations from external URLs.
This helps dealing with clickjacking and other XSS methods used to attack the client. To whitelist a url, add following to
__server/config/security.js__

```javascript
BrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(YOUR_URL);
```
